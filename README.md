Build a snake game using css,html,JS,canvas

snake game planning 

-build a board using canvas (maybe a 9x9 board)

-have the rules displayed at the bottom of the game board

-build a start game button ( thata also functions as a restart button)

-build a snake character that moves with AWDS keys and arrows 

-build an item that the snake eats that makes him bigger 

-build different obstacles for the snake to aviod 


-build a function if the snake intersects with itself a message pops up game over

-build a score board (each food item eaten is 10 points) in the top left

-build a stop watch in the top right 

-have a message put up when the game is over with the score and time 

-style the game using css 



In the game of Snake the player uses the arrow keys or AWDS to move a "snake" around the board. As the snake finds food it eats the food, and thereby grows larger. The game ends when the snake either moves off the screen or moves into itself. The goal is to make the snake as large as possible before that happens. There will be a a stopwatch keeping track of how long you survive and a score keeper that will print how much food the snake has eaten. 


Second game idea make a sudoku board game using only html,css,JS


functions to be made 

const gameBoard
const score
cosnt resetbutton
const snake

functions for the following

function gamestart
function reset or clear board
function createfood
