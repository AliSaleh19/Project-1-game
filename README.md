snake game planning 

build a board using canvas (maybe a 9x9 board)
have the rules displayed at the bottom of the game board
build a start game button ( thata also functions as a restart button)
build a snake character that moves with AWDS keys and arrows 
build an item that the snake eats that makes him bigger 
build different obstacles for the snake to aviod 
build a function if the snake intersects with itself a message pops up game over
build a score board (each food item eaten is 10 points) in the top left
build a stop watch in the top right 
have a message put up when the game is over with the score and time 
style the game using css
